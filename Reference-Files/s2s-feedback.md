Hey, dude, thanks for sending that over. I love it even down to the colors. I was actually going to change my colors to match my book on my Thread Genius. I dig it a lot. Matter of fact, the only feedback I have so far would be that I like exactly how it's set up. The only addition from that very last screenshot that you showed me where you had steps 1, 2, 3, I would say let's do that similarly: step 1, step 2, step 3\. My guessing is, and I probably go back and watch it uploading the voice DNA. That's something that they would probably do on step 2\. I would imagine somewhere in there they would need to upload the voice guide in order, and you probably I probably missed that or didn't pay attention enough. I'm watching video on my phone, so it's a little difficult for me to see. But I like everything that you're doing. I think step one, like in the exact way it's up, you don't need to change anything. I would just say step one would be triangle inside, step two would be the right in T1, and in step three would be the subject lines. I like just adding that little step in there so people don't know which one you want to start with when I log in here. The fact we only have three tools right now is because we want to go for MVP \- like, very simple, very clean, and very short, but yet still get the next step one, two, three. That's the only additional we've got. Otherwise, I love the direction it's going in. Let me know what you need from me. I do have a bunch of cool stuff on the if you were to do. I think I saw it in there; we need a drop-down for Noah's Mark. I think that was in there; it could be wrong, but if you know if you need it, I've got all of that kind of templated out and done too. Then I can definitely give you some information.

Thanks again\!

Inside Symptoms2Sales, when you log in for the course itself, I'm pretty sure you have that. I almost think it's impossible that you don't, so you can log in there and in the very first (no, it's down towards the middle of the course), it's not called Voice DNA, it's called something that's getting off the top of my head. But I give the exact way of how we create it.

Now, what I could do is I can show you. I probably should give you access to my Thread Genius, and I can do that in the morning and set you up with a coupon and give you access to that. You see how I've done it.

So, literally, I just have a uploader that loads up a PDF, and then the AI pulls (of course) the API from Claude, and then from there, it filters it through the Voice Guide when it's creating the T1.

So, probably on that second step for the T1, we have them upload the Voice Guide, which is just a PDF, right? And I'm probably guessing inside the actual software, we would do like I did with Thread Genius. I show them how to create the guide, and there's no video or anything because you don't need that. We just got them past the Symptoms2Sales members area. We just pull that out and put that as a little tab in there. It's kind of what I did with Thread Genius when they log in \- there's a tool quote unquote they click on, and it's a tab/tool that just opens up and shows them how to create the guide, and then they use that guide to upload into the tool.

So, I can put that together, you know, do your little Loom video in the morning before I head out for an appointment, and just show you what I did and incorporate it into this tool. Hopefully, that'll help, and my ramblings will make much more sense when I put it in a Loom. Sorry about that\!

### **Thread Genius App Walkthrough Transcript**

**\[00:00\] Visual:** Tony is on the "Thread Creator" page. He is hovering over the sidebar menu. **Tony:** "Hey guys, real quick, I’m sorry it took so long to get this over to you. I had some technical difficulties on my end, but here is the app that I’ve been talking about, Thread Genius A.I. I’m going to give you a coupon so you can get in here for free and play around with it as well."

**\[00:13\] Visual:** He scrolls down to a section titled "Voice Guide (Style PDF)." There is an upload box. **Tony:** "But just to show you what’s under the hood—this piece right here, the Voice Guide, the Style PDF. If I delete this one and I go to 'choose file' and I go to my 'Voice DNA'... I’m going to upload that."

**\[00:28\] Visual:** He moves to the "Knowledge Base (Book PDFs)" section. He points to an uploaded PDF titled "DOC-ebook02.pdf." **Tony:** "Now, the Knowledge Base—this is where you can upload up to five PDFs for domain expertise. So whatever documents you have that you want it to pull data from, you put it here."

**\[00:41\] Visual:** He scrolls to the "Generate Thread" section. It has a field for "Thread Topic" and a button that says "Brainstorm Viral Ideas." **Tony:** "Now, you can brainstorm viral ideas based on that data, or you can just come in here and say, 'I want to talk about...'—well, let’s just pull from the data. Let's see what it gives us here."

**\[00:54\] Visual:** He types into the "Additional Instructions" box: *“use lots of emojis and make it FUN to read.”* **Tony:** "In the 'Additional Instructions'—which is something we talked about having—I’m going to put 'use lots of emojis and make it FUN to read.' Call to Action: 'Join the waitlist.' And then I’m going to click 'Generate Thread'."

**\[01:10\] Visual:** The screen updates to show a "Generated Thread" box. It contains a "Main Post" followed by "Comment 1," "Comment 2," etc. **Tony:** "Now, what it’s doing is it's pulling from the voice DNA file, it's pulling from the knowledge base, and it's putting it into a thread format. And then, once it’s done, you can come in here and you can edit any of this. It’s all editable. But the cool part is, it's in your voice."

**\[01:28\] Visual:** He scrolls down to "Branded Image Generation." There are squares showing the thread text overlaid on background images for Facebook, LinkedIn, and Instagram. **Tony:** "And then down here, it actually generates the branded images for you as well. So for Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram—it puts the text on the images for you, and you can just download those."

**\[01:42\] Visual:** He clicks "Dashboard" in the sidebar, then clicks "Create Your Voice Guide." This page has a header: "Capture Your Unique Writing Voice." **Tony:** "Now, let’s go back to the dashboard. This 'Create Your Voice Guide'—this is the piece I was telling you about. I think we should have a tab for this. It walks them through how to actually create that Voice DNA file that they then upload into the tool."

**\[01:58\] Visual:** He moves his mouse over the "Training" and "Brand Settings" tabs. **Tony:** "So, I think where we talked about the T1 tool, or the initial setup—this Voice Guide piece is going to be huge. I’m going to provide you with all the PDFs I have for the 'Flood Maker' and the 'Symptoms to Sales' toolset, so you have those as well."

**\[02:15\] Visual:** He stops scrolling and looks at the camera (or stays on the dashboard). **Tony:** "I’m going to put them in little buckets on Google Drive for you—Noah’s Ark, general email stuff—so you can see how the AI uses that domain expertise combined with the user's voice to create this content. I’ll get that coupon over to you now so you can jump in and play."

Based on the video walkthrough, here are the specific UI elements and functional components Tony mentioned. You can use this list to build your app's requirements or "vibe code" the interface:

### **1\. Navigation & Workspace**

* **Sidebar Menu:** A fixed sidebar with links to the core tools:  
  * **Dashboard:** The central landing page.

  * **Multi-File Support:** Tony mentions a limit of **5 PDFs** for domain expertise.  
  * **File List:** A visual list of uploaded documents (e.g., "DOC-ebook02.pdf") so the user knows what data the AI is currently "reading."  
* **Input Controls:**  
  * **Thread Topic Field:** A text input for the main subject.  
  * **Brainstorm Viral Ideas Button:** A secondary action that suggests topics based on the uploaded PDFs before the user writes.  
  * **Additional Instructions (Optional):** A text area for custom prompting (e.g., "use lots of emojis").  
  * **Call-to-Action (CTA) Field:** A specific field to define the end goal (e.g., "Join the waitlist").

### **3\. Output & Review Section**

Once the AI finishes, the UI updates to show:

* **Editable Preview Area:**  
  * **Hierarchical Layout:** Displays a "Main Post" followed by numbered "Comments" (1, 2, 3, etc.) to mimic a real thread.  
  * **Inline Editing:** Every part of the generated text should be clickable and editable by the user.  
* **Branded Image Generation:**  
  * **Platform Tabs/Toggles:** Specific presets for **Facebook, LinkedIn, and Instagram**.  
  * **Text Overlay Engine:** UI that shows the thread text automatically laid over branded background images.
