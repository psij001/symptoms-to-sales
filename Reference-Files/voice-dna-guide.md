Writing Voice Alchemy Part 1
A.I. Writing Voice Alchemy
START HERE: Writing Voice Alchemy:
Alright, here’s the deal…

A writing voice isn’t some mystical thing you or your partners are born with.

It’s just a stack of patterns.  

Stuff that makes your partners writing feel like them. 

And when we’re training AI to sound like you or your partners, we’re focusing on four core ingredients:

Voice (your partners signature sound)

Style (your partners structural fingerprints)

Tone (the vibe)

Structure (how you shape the flow)

We’re mostly dialing in Voice and Style here. But Tone and Structure sneak in too ‘cause they all blend to form your unique flavor on the page.

By the time we wrap this up, you’ll have a crystal-clear breakdown of what makes your partners writing theirs.

And a template that lets AI crank out words that sound like they came straight from your brain.

🔧 Step 1: Grab Their Greatest Hits
Pull together 3-5 samples of your partners strongest writing. Stuff that screams “this is me.”

Personally, when using this to discover my own writing voice, I used 5 of my best performing Substack posts. 

Your partner likely has a ton of places you can pull from if you ask or look. 

Newsletter content,  emails, blogs, or written FB & IG posts are all great places to start. 

If you’re still figuring your voice out, cheat a little, use writing from someone you admire. It’ll help you spot what clicks with you (and what doesn't).

🤖 Step 2: Feed the Beast (AI Prompt Time)
Drop each writing sample into the ChatGPT one at a time using this prompt:

[PROMPT]

In this session we'll consider the difference between a writing voice and a writing tone.

The writing voice is the voice that stays consistent across all writing. The tone changes from piece to piece.

I need your help in understanding my writing voice so that I can create processes that will utilize my writing voice across content I'll generate with you. 

I'll give you some examples of my writing and you'll give me a maximum of 10 bullet points (less if you see everything fits in less) of what my writing voice is.

Understood?

[PROMPT]

After each run, the AI will spit out a list of voice traits. That’s your raw material.

🧪 Step 3: Merge the Madness
You’ll now have a few different lists of voice traits. Time to distill it down.

Use this second prompt:

[PROMPT]

Please remove duplicates and only output unique the unique voice traits in a simple to read bullet point list:

Understood?

[PROMPT]

This will consolidate and strip away the duplicates — leaving you with your core voice ingredients.

🔍 Step 4: Zoom in on Your Style
Now we get nerdy.

Run each sample back through AI using this breakdown prompt:

[PROMPT]

Analyze the WRITING STYLE (Without the tone, nor the voice) based on these criteria:

Word Choice: The specific vocabulary and terminology used.
Sentence Structure: How sentences are constructed, including length and complexity.
Rhythm and Pacing: The flow and tempo of the writing.
Point of View: The perspective from which the story is told.
Figurative Language: Use of literary devices like metaphors and similes.
Imagery: Descriptive language that creates visual images for the reader.
[PROMPT]

This isn’t about tone or personality. It’s the nuts and bolts:

Word choices

Sentence structures

Pacing

Perspective

Imagery

Metaphor use

AKA - the technical fingerprints of your writing.

🧬 Step 5: Merge Your Style Attributes
Just like you did with voice, consolidate your style traits using this:

[PROMPT]

Input all the style attributes you received from the previous step into this prompt:

Here is a list of writing style attributes. 

Please remove duplicates and only output the unique style traits in a simple to read bullet point list:

[INSERT STYLE ATTRIBUTES]

[PROMPT]

You’ll now have your own cheat sheet — a breakdown of how you build your writing.

🎯 Step 6: Create Your Voice Alchemy Doc
Now glue ‘em together — your voice traits + your style attributes.

[PROMPT]

Thank you. Now glue ‘em all together my voice traits + my style attributes and provide me with a document that I can upload anytime I want to refine copy so it sounds like me.

[PROMPT]

That’s Writing Voice Alchemy.

The instruction manual that lets AI become your writing apprentice in minutes not months.

Example:

Voice Traits

Candid and cheeky

Tells stories that teach

Speaks to the reader like a friend

Punchy and playful

Style Traits

Short, snappy sentences

Loves a good ellipsis...

Uses analogies that hit like gut punches

Bold words for emphasis (yep, even ALL CAPS sometimes)

First-person meets “you” talk for max engagement

🚀 Put Voice Alchemy to Work
When you’re using AI to write, upload your document to ensure the content that's kicked out is yours or if you're writing for a partners campaign, it's written in theirs. 

A SHORT version may look like this: 

"Write this in my style - casual, confident, story-driven, uses first-person and directly addresses the reader. Short sentences, active voice, metaphors, and rhetorical questions welcome."

👉 Want to sharpen it even more? Redo the process every few months as you or your partners writing evolves.

Writing Voice Alchemy Part 2
A.I. Writing Voice Alchemy
My Writing Voice Alchemy Example: 
I've given you an example of my voice DNA PDF. But come up with your own if you're wanting clone your own writing or your partners. Don't try to sound goofy like me! 

🧬 Writing Voice Alchemy: The Secret Sauce That Makes It Sound Like You
Alright, so here’s the real reason I wanted to show you this...

AI’s great. But if it doesn’t sound like you — or your partner — it falls flat.
That’s where the Voice DNA layer comes in. It’s the polish pass that makes the copy snap.

Because let’s be honest — nobody wants a sales email that reads like it was written by a slightly enthusiastic insurance bot.

🛠 How I Use Voice DNA in the Workflow
Step 1: Build the Foundation
Run through the full stack:

✅ Rudolph Story Tool

✅ Offer & Angle Creator

✅ Triangle of Insight

✅ T1 Creator Tool

Boom. Now you’ve got a solid first draft.

But here’s the kicker: before I hit send — or share it with a partner — I always run that copy through my Voice DNA template.

That’s what dials it in. That’s what makes it read like a human with a pulse wrote it.

⚙️ My Favorite Tool for This: Claude
I like Claude for rewrite passes — especially when I’m telling it:

“Shorter.”

“Punchier.”

“Trim the fat.”

“Make it sound like this voice.” (And then I feed it the Voice DNA PDF)

But even with Claude doing its thing, I still massage the output.

Because sometimes it comes out long in the tooth.
And we’re not writing dissertations. We’re writing cash-collecting emails.

✂️ Example in Action (Real Talk)
Dropped in a partner email. Looked like this when Claude spat it out:

“Calendar tools like Tetris Gone Wild, sales calls everywhere, 36 minutes each time you ain't getting back.”

🔥 Not terrible.
But all on one line = headache city.

✅ I split it out.
✅ Made it scannable.
✅ Trimmed the bloat.

Because if they can’t read it at a glance, they won’t read it at all.

And that’s how stuff ends up in the inbox graveyard.

📄 BONUS TIP: One-Page Rule = Ruthless Copy Discipline
If you’re keeping your email to one Google Doc page (like I do), you’ve gotta get savage.

Ask:

“Does this NEED to be here?”

“Would they miss it if I cut it?”

“Does it buy its way into the email?”

Most of the time? You can cut 15–25% and it reads stronger.

🧪 Why Voice DNA Is Non-Negotiable
This isn't just about writing in your voice…

It’s how we write in our partner’s voice, too.
Which makes their audience lean in instead of zone out.

And honestly? It saves hours.
You’re not starting from scratch trying to guess how someone talks.
You're injecting it straight in.

That’s why I renamed it:
Writing Voice Alchemy
Because that’s what it is — literal shortcutting to soul-sounding copy.

💬 Final Reminder
Yeah, this takes a bit of massaging.
But it’s still faster than trying to manually channel someone else’s voice from scratch.

It’s sharper.
Cleaner.
More persuasive.
And way more human.

Got questions? Drop ‘em in the group.
I’ll keep dropping more examples soon.

Let’s get this copy sounding like you — not some sales robot on a Red Bull binge.
