KEY POINTS for the Core of your offer and T3\'85

\
There is usually an identity and reputation they want to escape from... and new ones they'd like.

I often look for triggering events that widen the reputation gap suddenly.\
\
Break ups\
Offer stops working\
Economy blows up\
Job loss\
Kid goes to college\
Exit of a company\
Diagnosed illness\
Birth of a baby\
\
These cause earthquakes in the reputation foundation.\
\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf2 \outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec5 When the foundations that identity and reputation are built on are threatened...\
ie:\
-Job\
-Business\
-Family\
-Relationships\
\
It becomes easier for an offer to be heard because...\
\
Vulnerability is way up so the present-pain radar is screaming.\
\
And the value of the transformation skyrockets.\
\

\cf2 All emotional present pain is the reputation gap widening.\
\
Most marketing I see tries to claim status so people will submit to their "obvious superiority" and buy from them.\
\
We gain a fuck of a lot more status by AWARDING status to our people than fighting them for it\
\
or DEMANDING it from them.\cf5 \cb6 \
