\\\
There is usually an identity and reputation they want to escape from\\...\
and new ones they\\'d like.\\\
\\\
\\\
I often look for triggering events that widen the reputation gap\
suddenly.\\\
\\\
Break ups\\\
Offer stops working\\\
Economy blows up\\\
Job loss\\\
Kid goes to college\\\
Exit of a company\\\
Diagnosed illness\\\
Birth of a baby\\\
\\\
These cause earthquakes in the reputation foundation.\\\
\\\
When the foundations that identity and reputation are built on are\
threatened\\...\\\
ie:\\\
-Job\\\
-Business\\\
-Family\\\
-Relationships\\\
\\\
It becomes easier for an offer to be heard because\\...\\\
\\\
Vulnerability is way up so the present-pain radar is screaming.\\\
\\\
And the value of the transformation skyrockets.\\\
\\\
All emotional present pain is the reputation gap widening.\\\
\\\
Most marketing I see tries to claim status so people will submit to\
their \\"obvious superiority\\" and buy from them.\\\
\\\
We gain a fuck of a lot more status by AWARDING status to our people\
than fighting them for it\\\
\\\
or DEMANDING it from them.\\}
