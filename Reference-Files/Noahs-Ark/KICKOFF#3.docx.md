**Subj:** 411: WHY I’m NOT asking $10K for PRODUCT NAME

I’ve got an ulterior motive… 

What’s up? ... it’s Fred… 

Can’t visit long, gotta *big* night ahead of me\!

But, man, folks have been dropping me emails and popping me one private message after another over these last few notes. So firstly, I just want to say, THANK YOU\! 

My gratitude tank is filled up to the brim:-) 

I'm so happy, so many people are EXCITED to hear from me\!

Seems I’ve struck a chord too? Peeps are fed up with Facebook.

Rightly so, IMO. 

As Facebook ad costs surge and big biz competition chokes out the small biz person’s cash flow… I’ve been *quietly* running ads on Google Display Network (GDN) and Native Ads for my clients, and making a literal fortune doing it. 

I haven’t made a big “to do” about it, but...

There are only a FEW fishermen and women in these waters, and this “lake” is chock full of hungry fish practically jumping in the boat before I can even get the bait in the water\!

These aren’t minnows either\!

These are big fish…. Clients desperate to spend $10K to $100K PER DAY\! 

Listen, I can only fry up so many fish, ya know? My family is well fed and taken care of. Right now though, what I need is some GOOD help from ETHICAL people to fill this demand. 

So, I hope that may be where YOU come into play? 

Because what I’m about to release gives even the *newest* guy or gal in business a BIG advantage: being one of the FEW people with the cupboard full of goods to feed this STARVING CROWD and get in front of this feeding frenzy, FIRST.

Being one of the first and few does NOT come around very often \- in any industry. I’m darn certain fortunes will be made. 

Now, when it comes to speed and how fast you can build a RECURRING income...I don’t see *ANY* other business which compares to running an ad agency, but NOT ON FACEBOOK...NOT anymore\!

But learn even one Facebook alternative? Like GDN and/or Native Ad networks?

And STAND BACK, because there’s SO much demand\!

I know because I’m an EYEWITNESS:-)

...because of the urgency of this demand, I am going to walk folks through getting their first $2,500+ per month client and delivering EXCELLENT results. Our goal is going to be to do it in the next 30 days\! 

In fact, when I’ve given the right people even just a little direction, I’ve seen them pick up new clients in just a few days. 

Now $2,500 per month with just ONE CLIENT may not be a fortune? 

Getting 3 or 4 clients and nail $10K every month still won’t put a Lambo in your garage by next week… BUT, it sure can change someone’s financial picture in a hurry. 

Because it’s simple to get clients when there’s RED-HOT DEMAND...we won’t even need to spend one cent on ads.

Those are just some of the reasons why…

I could easily hang a $10,000 price tag on this PRODUCT NAME and have my pick of people to invest at that price. 

(And, right now, I’m not even talking about the $10K+ of OTHER goodies I’ve got in store for folks who invest in this exciting adventure with me.)

BUT… 

Here’s what’s up… 

**I absolutely, do NOT want people jumping in just because the money is so good.**

Am I serious?

I totally am. 

Look, I put off for a long-time teaching EVERYTHING I know about this, because I’ve always done so well running my own agency. 

But right now, there’s such a shortage of media buyers who know how to run ads on ANY major platform. (It’s not like you can learn this in college.)

I feel called to help. 

While I’m not going to ask $10k...

...I’m sure it will still be a significant investment for some folks. The investment is necessary because I ONLY want to train serious and ETHICAL people who want to be GREAT at what they do, and HELP their clients grow their businesses. 

And I believe by lowering the barrier to entry, but asking a FAIR PRICE, I’ll ultimately put more EXCELLENT agency owners out into the world.

The LAST THING our industry needs is more crappy agencies\!

If you're one of the rare action-takers who cares about delivering results to your clients… How about we to tackle this opportunity together?

What I want for you to hear is how important it is to keep “high standards” for our blossoming industry. 

Yes, we will make recurring income together. Lots of recurring income…  

Because money (that lasts) is a BY-PRODUCT of EXCELLENCE. And, I DON’T believe you’ve got to work yourself to an early grave to be excellent. I think FREE TIME is also a byproduct of PRODUCING excellence.

Ya feel me on that too?

HIGH FIVE\!

If all goes well and there are no tech snafus… I’ll send you an email with an invitation on Sunday evening.

After you get it Sunday eve, just follow the directions to RSVP and reserve your spot. 

Thank you, again\!

Your \#1 Fan,   
Fred
