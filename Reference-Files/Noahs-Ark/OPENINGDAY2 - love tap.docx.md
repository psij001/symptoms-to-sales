subj: 2 PREnups to a quickly profitable biz...

Before you “marry” any biz, read this...

Fred popping by real quick…

Last night I gently opened the doors to a rare special edition of our PRODUCT NAME

People are claiming the few spots I’ve set aside, right now.

Before they know it, they’ll be sitting in a very envious financial position because they are going to be one of the FEW people on this old blue planet who can run ads PROFITABLY on ANY ad network (Including Facebook).

So, what?

Who cares?

You might ask, “Fred, tell me why I should give 2 shakes?”

Well, maybe you SHOULDN’T?

But, if you like money? And you want it to be much easier to make?

Let me lay this down for ya.

Whether you EVER buy anything from me, this will be something which will make you max money in minimum time…

If you remember it:-)

I’m not saying to print this out and marry it into your memory, but it wouldn’t hurt.

Here’s what I think the 2 prenups on a quickly profitable biz should be:

1\. Sell what people are ALREADY buying  
2\. Be one of the FEW who are offering it \- rather than spending YEARS trying to become the best in an overcrowded marketplace. 

When folks jump into this special edition of PRODUCT NAME…

They are going to be the SPECIAL EDITION NAME of media buyers/ad agencies because they’ll know how to run ads profitably on any major ad network (including Facebook). 

Right now: 1\. There’s a raging demand and people are ALREADY BUYING this service when they can FIND IT and 2\. There are only a precious few “Swiss Army Knives” of media buyers available and they are COMMANDING top dollar \- getting it too. 

These two prenups don’t line up often, but when they do, I’ve seen real “idiots” get rich so fast it makes heads spin.  

Now, I’m not looking to help “idiots”, LOL.

I’m just sayin…

Put these 2 pre-nups in before you get married to a biz and you’ll hit your money goals much, much faster.

I’m not trying to make a big “splash” with these few openings and now you know why:-) I want to stay one of the few. 

If you’d like to join us, I’m not saying to drop everything right this second, but I don’t know how much longer I’ll be accepting folks?

**\===\> I want to be one of the few, I’m IN\!**

Your \#1 Fan,   
Fred

P.S. Maybe you’ve already got a great biz? Then you can use this to multiply your leads and sales on the other ad networks...other than FB. It’s a lot less hassle:-)

**\===\> Gimme more leads and sales on other ad networks\!**
