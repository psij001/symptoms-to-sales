SUBJECT: (BIG PROBLEM) Facebook IS overcrowded \- what it means for you?  

The FB boat may be sinking for many...

Fred here… 

I want to keep you fully informed of some critical changes that are taking place right now in online advertising... 

Shall we dig in? 

If you've been following me on FB, you've probably heard me talking about how… And maybe you’ve noticed? 

Facebook is as crowded as HELL right now. And it ain’t getting any better\! 

In fact… I'd even go so far as to say there's an EMERGENCY going on in the online advertising space now. A full blown, red lights twirling and flashing, sirens screaming, emergency. Now, I know that may sound a bit dramatic, but…

Check this… 

FBs latest quarterly reports show that over 6 MILLION businesses advertise on their platform\!  
They’re bursting at the seams with advertisers. 

Now, you may be thinking… Sounds great if you want to grab a slice of that pie and run your own FB Ad Agency, right? But before you jump on that... 

Here’s a nasty stat that's lurking in the hallways of Facebook… Straight from Facebook CFO, Dave Wehner's own mouth at one of their recent Earnings Calls: “We anticipate AD LOAD on Facebook will continue to grow modestly over the next 12 months…” 

What’s this all mean to you? 

Facebook is hitting MAX AD LOAD. There’s MILLIONS of advertisers and only so many more ADS they can squeeze into folks newsfeeds. What are they going to do when there's no more ROOM for folks to place their ads? 

Well…

It’s already happening. They're INCREASING ad costs right now. One stat showed the average cost is up 35% over the year before. 

POOF\!

There goes your profits into the night. 

All your testing and optimizing and hard work is wiped away just like that… Zuckerberg and his minions? 

They don't give a damn about your income. Their CHIEF concern right now is in protecting and serving their community… (A good thing, but…)

...R.I.P. Steady leads, sales, and profits.  
...Hello User Experience over ROI.

And while this is all happening… It’s also looking like they’ll whip up even more STRICT GUIDELINES\! So, expect for your “compliant ads” today, to trigger their newest “Red Flags” at any time. 

You may get disapproved…and/or banned without any notice…and watch your profits twirl down   
the toilet. 

This is all happening NOW folks. 

It's not my opinion… I'm just the weather forecaster. And I want to keep you safe from the storm:-) 

And PLEASE know this… I’m not trying to “knock” Facebook.  

It’s just that they’re in their teenage years right now… Just like Google was back in 2009\. And as we all know, going through puberty can SUCK… 

Massive growth doesn’t happen without reaching this TIPPING POINT. 

I’ve seen this song and dance before with other ad networks. And that's why I want to let you in on something and save you some time, income, and headaches… Because as I mentioned yesterday? 

There IS a way to turn this sh\*t into sugar\! And I want to be sure you know alllllll about it. 

I’ve literally had guys who are quietly bringing in a fortune with this telling me to Keep My Mouth Shut… But, I want to help out the little guys and gals too\!

While many are still battling it out on Facebook like it’s a UFC fight, as their ad costs reach near unbearable… While they’re grinding away 50, 60, 70+ hrs per week…sacrificing family time just to keep the biz afloat one. more. day. at. a. time? 

There will be a few others taking ethical advantage on the RIGHT SIDE of these massive waves of new opportunity… 

See… There’s a NEW PLAN at play now… It’s for anyone who's feeling overworked and wants to lighten their load, and bring in more income, asap… All by working less and less, in one of the most IN-DEMAND markets now.

Soooooooo… For a few savvy souls… I’ve got a small, sturdy boat to help them weather the storm and create a steady stream of income DESPITE what's going on with Facebook.

I’m going to support them every step of the way, because… 

There’s a MOUNTAIN OF DEMAND waiting for us, if you’re open for it? So just a quick heads up… I’m looking to share this exclusive info with a few movers-and-shakers that want in on something special. 

And… 

I want to make sure you’re all fully informed about these changes and where things are heading. 

That way, at least you’ll be able to make an educated decision one way or the other. 

Cool? 

If you’ll roll out the welcome mat and keep the lights on for me… I’ll be back soon to share more 411 with you.

Would that be alright? 

\- Fred
