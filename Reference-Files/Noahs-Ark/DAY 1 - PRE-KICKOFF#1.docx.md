**Subj:** State of Facebook Ads 2018 (Changes which may affect you)

What’s up? It’s Fred here… 

A quick heads up for you… 

If you’re on Facebook right now, you  
may have noticed that it’s becoming  
more and more crowded? 

Ad costs are rising faster than health  
care premiums I think? 

Well, maybe not THAT fast?

BUT\!

It’s super important we understand   
big changes taking place right now. 

Sooooo… 

If you plan on being in this business   
for any length of time. 

I have some important 411 to share   
with you, on the state of advertising  
online. 

Are you cool if I stopped by maybe a   
bit more often over the next couple of   
weeks? 

I just want to make sure you’re fully   
informed and understand the direction   
everything is headed.

I’ve also figured out how to turn the   
changes and crisis into opportunity  
too. (AKA Turning Sh\*t into Sugar.)

Hope you won’t mind the extra  
visits?
