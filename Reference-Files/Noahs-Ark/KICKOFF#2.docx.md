**SUBJECT:** (PART 2\) The Facebook Crisis and you...

It’s happening now...

Fred here, reporting back… 

Welcome to part 2 on what I consider to be an urgent situation which likely affects you on Facebook’s Ad platform right now. 

I’ve actually been telling folks this for awhile now. I saw it coming. Now, it’s here. If folks businesses rely on Facebook, their businesses are in peril. 

I’m not trying to “scare you straight”, there’s actually a silver lining in this for some. 

In our last note, we talked about the big SKUNK in the room right now \- **Facebook is reaching Max Ad Load.** This ain’t no joke, folks.

Right now, Mark Zuckerberg's saying their users security and experience is MORE important than their PROFITS and Advertisers. Which basically means… They can’t slap any more ads in front of folks faces\! 

There’s no ROOM left on their scrolling blue billboard.

Now, they ARE trying to fix things. For instance, leveraging AI (Artificial Intelligence) is one plan they’ve mentioned for the future. 

But, who knows if and when that will ever happen?? 

They can “try” to offer advertisers more *perks*, like better targeting…Or, better features, like auto-play video…Or, even multi-ad carousels...And WHY would they do this? 

Because meanwhile, back in the real world of business and profits...

They have to *justify* why you’ll be paying 35% or more EXTRA as they increase Ad Costs more and more. We see the trends already…

…Ad costs so high it’s hard to get positive profits for too long anymore. 

...Ad guidelines are even stricter which takes up more of your time to learn and follow. (Who can keep up, unless you’ve got your own FB Rep whispering warnings in your ear every week?) 

...Banned ad accounts and more disapproved ads are sweeping through like this year’s flu.  (Have BACKUPS\!)

...Constantly changing your marketing strategy to give FB whatever “flavor of the week” they want to see. It hurts emotionally and makes the pocket book bleed when you’re forced to change a profitable campaign. 

On top of that… you may be smelling more stank?

With all the FOLKS on FB… And with mass ad load being reached… It “smells” like opportunity is beginning to turn from RIPE to ROTTEN for agencies who ONLY run FB ads. 

You’re prolly seeing this too? Seems everybody has got an Aunt or brother-in-law who does “Facebook Ads”. It’s made for a very cutthroat marketplace \- FB Ad Agencies are becoming a commodity. 

Don’t get me wrong, it still can be lucrative, for a few. But... 

You merge Max Ad Load and Max Agency Load together, and mix it up? And what you get is more crowding on a ship already sinking under the weight of complexity and hefty ad spends. 

Will anybody survive? Could be the BIG agencies equipped to manage 50+ clients for low fees? 

BIG companies with multi-million dollar budgets may feel it, but they’ll survive. Adhering to FBs newer stricter rules, and higher ad costs just to play in their court is NOT the lifestyle friendly biz most of my I.M. friends want.  

So, before you need to run to the liquor cabinet, let’s look at the GOOD NEWS, shall we?

Let me explain it like this:

If you were to set up shop, and open up a new GROCERY STORE in town…  Would you rather be the FIRST to market, and be one of the ONLY spots in town folks could get their groceries?

Or, would you rather be set up and doing biz in a market with 1,000+ other grocery stores competing for customers? 

Seem like a silly question? Stay with me...

Right now… if we like money?...and we want to have a business which serves us and not the other way around? We NEVER want to offer what everyone else is offering\! We also do NOT want to guess what we *think* the market wants\! 

**We DO want to be...ONE of the *first (or few) to the market, handing out what people DESPERATELY WANT\!***

OK, so… Am I making sense so far? 

Because, that’s why we are HERE right now. :-) While many are barely treading water on FB, hoping Zuck sends a lifeboat...others are already sinking NOW. 

So huddle in with me for a sec… 

I truly feel one of my “jobs” is to keep you well informed… And as a Media Buyer AND a Media Agency Owner… There’s hardly a week that goes by that someone isn’t asking me for a guy or gal to run GDN (Google Display Network)...and/or Native Ads for them. 

Did ya get that? ^^^

And these are businesses with BIG MONEY\! See, where folks spend $100 to $1K a day on Facebook Ads… 

These businesses will spend $10K to $100K PER DAY on GDN and Native Ads\! (Think they'll mind paying you $5k or $10k per month out off that?)

Now, I can spat off a dozen FB guys just from memory alone… But for agencies who offer ads on other media outlets like GDN or Native? I only know *one* guy (other than me) who I can recommend them to. 

The problem with that? I’m always booked. And he’s always booked.  

But, there’s a mountain of demand RIGHT NOW for people who can run ads OFF of Facebook\!

So, as this “golden goose” is laying her golden eggs in my lap, I got to thinking…  I know ALL the ins-and-outs to set this up and do it right, so it’s totally lifestyle friendly\!

PLUS, one of the BIG SECRETS of running ads on GDN or native networks is once you get the campaigns set up, you don’t have to fuss with them much. This leaves a guy or gal with a whole bunch of free time. 

In fact, I’ve put everything into a step-by-step program which would set you up to be one of the FEW Swiss Army Knives of Media Buyers which is in HUGE DEMAND, right now\! 

I know, you’d need more details to decide for sure…

But, I’m curious if you’d want to know more?

Even though I COULD, because there’s the potential to make the investment back so fast, I will NOT be asking $10,000 for the program and my help.

With all that’s going on with Facebook, I really want to help a few folks not only weather this big storm, but come out of it, better off than ever before.

When I am finished with these folks, they’ll be able to run ads on ANY NETWORK for themselves AND/OR for others at $2500 to $10k a MONTH.

I’m also happy (with conditions) to hook them up with the business I can’t handle on my own. 

I gotta tell ya, the seas are MUCH smoother sailing AWAY from Hurricane Facebook. 

Would you like to join us?
