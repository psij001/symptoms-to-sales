💸 The Offer Foundation Tool: The BS Meter for Your Offer
Here’s the deal—before you build a house, you check the foundation. Same goes for your offer.

This tool ain’t just for coming up with clever words.
It’s here to answer one very unsexy, ultra-powerful question:

“If I said ‘Give me $X, and I’ll give you Y’… would that actually be believable… or sound like a bad late-night infomercial?”

That’s the whole vibe. We’re pressure-testing reality here. You can’t fake this.

🧪 The Setup: The “Give Me / I’ll Give You” Test
This is your first sniff test.
It’ll either make you go:

😬 “Ehhh… that sounds like fluff.”

🤷‍♂️ “Meh. Could work.”

🔥 “Damn. That SLAPS.”

You run your offer idea through this “value-for-money” lens to see if it passes the gut check.

🧠 Tool Output: The Offer Angle Analyzer
The AI hands you 3 offer angles. Not just random buzzwords, but actual framing devices you can use to sell real stuff to real people who are overworked and jaded.

Let’s break them down like we’re in the war room:

🔓 Angle #1: The Agency Owner Liberation Play
“Give me $10,000/month for 7 months and I’ll show you how to walk away from your computer for 2 weeks straight…
while your agency runs itself and deposits $100K monthly into your bank account.”

This one hit. 💥
Why?

It’s clean.

It paints a clear outcome.

It punches pain: “trapped behind your computer.”

It flips status: you go from operator to overseer.

✅ This one passed the bar.
❌ BUT we had to chop out the corporate cringe:

“the exact team building blueprint…”
No one knows what that means. It sounds like SaaS trying to be clever. Toss it.

🙃 Angle #2: The Client Magnet
“I’ll position you as the go-to Facebook ads expert… so premium clients chase you.”

Yawn.
This one feels like a promise from 2016.

“Premium clients”

“Begging to pay retainers”

You’re not gonna stand out by parroting the same language as every funnel bro with a Canva account. Next.

🚨 Angle #3: The “Facebook Just Killed My Ads” Lifeboat
“I’ll show you how to keep your clients profitable even when Facebook kills their ads overnight…”

There’s something here.

It’s speaking to fear — the “oh sh*t, ad account banned” moment.
But it still needs a tweak to feel immediate and inevitable. Otherwise, it risks sounding like insurance.

🔄 Run It Again, Baby
Didn’t love all three? Good.

This tool lets you hit “spin again” and generate more. It’s like a slot machine for ideas—except the jackpot is market resonance, not fake dopamine.

Examples from the re-roll:

“Turn your phone off at 5PM and don’t check it again until Monday.”

“Add $25K/mo using my exact hiring + training templates.”

👀 Useful, but still not as punchy as Angle #1.

⚙️ Your Role: More Context = Better Gold
The tool is a mirror. If you feed it vague soup, it’ll spit back lukewarm broth.
But if you layer in real, lived details from your offer worksheet, this thing can crank out messaging that sells before you even show up.

More context =
More clarity =
More conversions.
