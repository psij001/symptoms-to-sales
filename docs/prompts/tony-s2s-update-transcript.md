Date: Dec 4

Transcript:
 
Them: Hey, dude.  
Me: Hey, how you doing?  
Them: Good man. You're looking rather angelic with such.  
Me: I was going to say it's the perfect time of day. To just get blasted with the sun here.  
Them: Hey, listen, it sounds healthy for us. It's good.  
Me: Yeah. How you doing?  
Them: That's awesome, dude. I've been good, man. It's so funny. Because we'd obviously had talked about chatting even before that post it came up. And I've been good. Lots going on. Let's just say, like, in a good way.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: I'll just kind of land with you where my head is at, if we don't mind just jumping and diving right in.  
Me: Yeah, sure.  
Them: I'm in the. I've been in the air about closing the Meaningful Man Group. And I'm probably still going to do that, but in a sense where I think what I'll end up doing is moving everybody from there. Over into the DOC group now that we have tiers. That. I've just got one thing to manage.  
Me: That makes sense.  
Them: Right. So that's one thing, because I really. I want to keep my focus on my deals.  
Me: Seems like a smart move. Yeah.  
Them: Yeah, and just consolidate some of the energy that's kind of going out. You know, I've got my. My new fave thing now is the SaaS stuff, which is, you know, fun. I think I've got about, as of today, 15 or 16. Users for the. The. What you call it the thread. Genius.  
Me: Well, genius. Yep.  
Them: So that's cool. I haven't really super pushed it, you know, just been kind of more like getting feedback from people that are in it. That sign up for it. So I kind of want that to be a little bit of a focus. See if that will take off. And then, you know, Jason and I are doing the creator finder. Which we're working on 2.0 right now, which should be. Matter of fact, I'm meeting with him tomorrow to kind of see where we're at as far as, like, getting the initial beta of that out. In the group. We think that thing could be, you know, serious, you know, from a SaaS standpoint, because it goes outside of even just our deal world, you know, freelancers. I think there's a. There's something to be said that there's a, you know, could be very well be a enterprise level.  
Me: See that? Yeah.  
Them: You know, for companies or brands that want to get into influencers, which there are a couple of those out there, but they're not going to do what we're doing, you know, right now. So that's going to be a real focus as soon as he gets live with version two. And then also Floodmaker AI, which will go along with the Floodmaker itself or auctions or whatever, you know, so controlled environment. Now to do, you know, auctions, which I haven't talked to Travis about that yet, but we're certainly going to do testing on that. And then also, you know, so kind of moving some of my focus into the SaaS stuff for a couple reasons. Which is why I thought it was interesting seeing what you were doing as well. And I'm looking like. I'm just. I've never been happy with. And not anything that you've done or not done, but I've not been entirely happy with the symptoms to sales, mainly because of what we're having to force. It seems like we're forcing a cow through a straw.  
Me: Yeah. Pickaxe.  
Them: With. With pickaxe. So it's just like, you know, it's better than a sharp stick in the eye, but it's just never produced the stuff that I've been able to pull off inside of Claude. And using that as an API, like right now I'm using. I built everything on Manus with the thread. Genius, but I'm using Claude's API on it.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: So it's pretty ninja. I'll. I'll share with you real quick. Let me give you sharing stuff, too, in case you ever want to. Let's go to here. So this is what it's producing. In the back end. So upload the book or whatever, PDFs, whatever you want for context. Your voice doc so that it writes in your voice. You can brainstorm viral ideas. Got about 32 different viral things. And it pulls from gives you this. I could go. You know, stick this in here. I can stick in a, you know, custom call to action, or just give it additional options that I want it to pull from. And then I can do a custom call to action, which I have here, or I can pull from any one of these that are generic. Somebody got paid. Oh, yeah. Somebody signed up for something in school. Looks like.  
Me: Nice.  
Them: Christian Libel signed up. There you go. Yeah.  
Me: There you go.  
Them: Awesome. And then it'll pull from the guide in the book, and then it'll generate a viral hook image for Facebook, LinkedIn carousel images, and then also Instagram stories. So I can come in here. Here's the thread. If I just want to copy that.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: I can edit the thread if I need to. And then it'll. And then click regenerate images and it'll update all these. So this is the Facebook image. These are the. Actually, these. So for LinkedIn carousels it has been PDF form. And then. So you just upload these into PDF form and it'll do that, and it looks really cool over on LinkedIn. And then this is the Instagram stories. So all that's produced, like, bam. Like that.  
Me: Oh, that's huge.  
Them: And then what they can do is and come in here and configure brand settings. So you can change your primary colors to your brand if you want, put your logo custom in there, you can use these backgrounds or you can upload your own custom background. I'm training AI on my face and stuff, so I had to go do a bunch of screenshots. Let's go to desktop. Desktop, too. There it is. And then. Go in there for? Oh, yeah, my custom images. I don't need to do all that. I can go over to Desktop. Thread. Genius. And then background images. So I can pull, like, custom images if I want. Like that one. Control the opacity. You know, I can put a picture of me up front and me in there if I wanted to. Like, a lot of influencers might want to, like, have a custom image and put it in there.  
Me: Yeah, I could see that.  
Them: And then you could choose this, this, this, and so this is the crazy stuff I've been playing with.  
Me: Man. That's awesome.  
Them: And then if I go back, To the dashboard. I've got, like, Thread Creator. I've got the Voice Guide. In here. I've got brand settings, bonus resources. Viral hook formulas thread library. If they want to come in here and play with their own thread stuff. I'll do a content calendar, engagement boost, and then platform specific stuff. Those will come soon. And then for me, I can see analytics of, you know, how many threads, who's doing what. You know, this Tony Teagard dude's running up a pretty high number. I need to kick him out, right?  
Me: Keep an eye on him. Yeah.  
Them: Yeah. Keep an eye on that guy. Settings, which for me, for API stuff, and then I can get feedback from people. So so far I've only had, you know, that. But this has been a ton of fun. I did it relatively quickly. And. Yeah, and now, you know, of course, with Gemini is supposed to be super crazy, you know, doing all of that, which caught my interest when I saw you talking about that, too. So, yeah, and that's kind of where my head's at, but I don't know. What or if. Or you know, you may not be interested at all. There's a part of me that's wanted to take the symptoms to sales thing. And create something that is more. Encapsulized. And not contained within Kajabi in that sense, which I wish it could be, but it doesn't need to be. But something, you know, like I've been doing. One more thing I'll share. Over in my. Like my writing emails, Mojo. Like, because this just performs way better. You know, I've got my project over here. It's got all my Travis stuff. It's got all the things I need for context. My book. And then I can just come over here and, you know, create emails. Some of this might not be relevant, but. Yeah, I just use the crap out of Claude for a lot of my content creation.  
Me: Yeah, I'm worth it.  
Them: And, you know, and if there was something that was way more consolidated and already trained on what we do like that, I think people would use it more, especially in the group. Even though I'm going to be transitioning the group, I think of, you know, from where they are. I still want people to have stuff that makes their life easier like that. And because I need it. That's the number one thing of creating this stuff, is because it solves my problem first.  
Me: I'm with you. Yeah.  
Them: You know what I mean? So I don't know if there's anything there that we would want to do and then, you know, pop it out, but something that. Was more user friendly and, of course, would produce what the hell we know it's capable of producing.  
Me: Yeah, which will make a big difference, I think.  
Them: So huge difference. You know it. Chances are it's probably going to be its own interface, kind of like Creator Finder. You know what I mean? And I don't know what you know. And again, like, cost wise, like with API, stuff like that, I don't think it's going to be too huge of a deal. You know, based on what you know, based on what people are paying monthly. You know, I haven't pushed really hard to get a lot of new people in there. Just simply because it's like. I. I've got to probably change one thing in there about onboarding. When people come on board, it's like I shut down a bunch of stuff so they didn't have access to it. And now I need to do something that onboards like. Hey, here's where you first start. You know?  
Me: Walk them through.  
Them: Walk them through like your step one, step two, step three, step four. Don't deviate from this. Work with your warm market first. Reach out. Right, that sort of thing.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: So. Which won't take me long at all to do. I can knock that out in an afternoon, but. But I haven't really pushed really super hard. The doc group is what I feared because it's free. You know, it's like, you know, but the people who come in from it are real serious, you know, the ones that do transition. So, anyway, I just. I still want to create the tool, even if it was just for me and you. And if it's really badass and it works really, really well, then it's like, obviously we would, you know, roll it out. I don't know that we would charge. The people. Well, we wouldn't charge the people that are existing in there now because I'd be eliminating the. I might leave the. The symptoms to Sales AI Tool. It just seems disingenuous to keep that, but then charge them for something new.  
Me: Yeah. Yeah, I could see that.  
Them: Right. But, you know, we could either talk to Travis about rolling it out, you know, to a wider audience, or, you know, rolling it out to people that are in our world. I mean, it doesn't have to be contained to just that group. That would be my thing, is that we make it more available. So I don't know. It's just what's been banging around in my crazy head, but I don't know if there's anything there or not, so.  
Me: Yeah. Yeah, no, I think it. It seems like a smart move in my head anyways, like, and, you know, the way you're thinking about it, too, in terms of, like, you know, keep Access 1.0 available for the people who have had it, and then, you know, grab us. Always brings in 2.0, 3.0 or whatever. So, you know, I think people are kind of.  
Them: Y. Ep.  
Me: Accustomed to that anyways, at least in our ecosystem. So, yeah, bringing that in with a new, new user interface and obviously, like, outcome and output from that, that would be way beyond what it's currently doing just because of Pickaxe's limitations. But, yeah, I think that seems like a good idea and, you know, like. Like you were saying, between Gemini and Claude's new thing and, like, stuff like that together, I don't think it would be super hard even, like, having a front end and back end sort of thing behind it, so.  
Them: Y. Ep? Yep. Exactly. Right. And I could probably do it on my own, but it's kind of like. I don't really want to. I, you know, I want to be involved because obviously I know what I want it to produce, and I've got, you know, I've got some pretty solid. Prompts. And then, of course, you know, providing everything of Travis's. The reason why. I think Travis could maybe get behind it. Maybe not. It just. He's weird sometimes about this. But loading it with his ip. You know, so I would. If I'm gonna charge it any way, shape or form. I mean, I'm already giving him 10% on everything I do out of the meaningful man group. So it's just adding to stick rate, you know, and then if we do want to sell it outside of that fact, he gets 10% of it anyway, you know, because it's his IP, right?  
Me: Right. Yep.  
Them: So, you know, I kind of look at it as like that might be something he could be down for. Maybe not. But I want us to build it anyway. And if you weren't on board, I was going to say, okay, well, let me. Let me jack around with it and figure out how I can do it anyway. I built this thing pretty, Pretty easily. And, you know, I could probably do the same with the other, but.  
Me: I was curious if this was you or J that put this together, but that's pretty slick.  
Them: Now, that's 100% me. Yeah.  
Me: Oh, man.  
Them: I did it all through Manis. You know, Manis makes it again, makes it easy, because being a, you know, AI agent, more or less, it does the coding and, you know, it's still, like, probably like Gemini to a certain degree. It's. You know, you do have to sit there and, like, it'll. Act retarded and, you know, debug stuff when it says it does or certain things are going on, but, I mean. Overall. I mean, I built it in, like, four days. Three, four days, probably a couple hours a day. In between doing other stuff, you know? And then I've just been tweaking on it for the last probably week and a half to get it to really output what I wanted it to. And then I realized, like, I got to only give it one thing, to focus on it at a time rather than like, hey, you did this. But then all this stuff is wrong. I figured out like once I went to one on one, it was like, okay, it figured out. So it's user error on some of that as well. But you know, I went. I upgraded to the 199amonth on manis, but it's. Been well worth it, you know, from the standpoint of usability.  
Me: Yeah. That's what it seems like. Yeah. I've been. Yeah. Mostly playing around with. I mean, for. For UI stuff like the. The clean, good looking front ends. Like Gemini 3. Seems like that's awesome for that sort of stuff.  
Them: Haven't played with it, but I do get that impression, yeah.  
Me: But, yeah, so I've seen a lot of people that are, like, getting something that looks really clean on the front with Gemini 3 and then, like, playing on, man. What was Claude's new thing that came out last week? I think a week or two.  
Them: Oh, yeah.  
Me: Opus 4.5.  
Them: Yep.  
Me: But that's been a beast. I've been playing with that. Everything from like, coding some of this stuff to even, like, writing. I'm writing VSLs with stuff, and I'm just like, you know, I want something that looks like this. Here's an example. Spit it out in this tone. It's giving. Like, even the writing is really good, which I was stunned.  
Them: Y. Ep. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Yeah. Yeah, I love I use Claude for all my writing stuff. Chat GPT is kind of going backwards and I just a little bit of an obnoxious usage.  
Me: By. Yeah.  
Them: But Claude has been my go to for all my writing stuff, and I just. I really dig it. So that's why I was like,  
Me: It hasn't gone wrong, and it just seems that it keeps getting better with it.  
Them: This dude. Better. Yeah. Now, I have not toyed with Gemini whatsoever.  
Me: Thrilled with.  
Them: That's the next thing on my plate to kind of start to play with. But, yeah, I think if we were to. Pop something together or start again. I just want to do it for our own usability. And then, you know, that goes well and it starts, you know, it's easy to use, and it does what we want it to do. Then. You know, we could roll it out, you know, into the group and even maybe talk to Travis about it. So we'll see. I think he's. He's probably less about that. Kind of life because he wants people to, like, know it and not get, you know, their brains get. So. But at the same time, it's like, dude, this is going to get out. I'm going to share it with people. So if you don't want to get paid on it, it's fine. You. Know.  
Me: Right. Yeah.  
Them: He'll be like, no. You used all my ip. You want to pay me anyway, bitch? So we'll see. It's all good. But, yeah, I plan on throwing it out there and then, you know. I haven't been in Ronan a whole lot just because I've been so focused on other things, but I just go in there. Yeah. If I go in there and I start tinkering and talking and toying around, like, people being like, oh, you know.  
Me: Yeah. Same.  
Them: Same thing with fire. Yeah, yeah. And same thing with fire group, you know? Like I said, I'll tell Travis. Like, dude, I'm going to do it anyway. You're going to get paid, so just, you know, you know.  
Me: May as well get on board. Huh?  
Them: Might as well get on board because I word's going to get out and people are going to want it and you're going to want to get paid, so using your stuff for it.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: That's it? Yeah. I don't know. Best way to maybe start toying around with that or working with it or whatnot, but I don't know if you have any ideas.  
Me: Yeah. I mean, first thought would just be, you know, get a sort of prototype of what it might look like and get that just so you know, so at least we know that the parts are in the right place and it looks the way that you kind of have in mind because, you know, it sounds like user experience and making it all kind of consolidated in one spot.  
Them: Okay? Yep. Y. Ep.  
Me: Is a priority there, so, yeah. I'd probably start with that. Just making sure it looks. Nice and consolidated, and then we can. Build out the functionality from there. Make sure it's got all the, the components that we liked about all the pieces and the weight before, but make sure the outputs, you know, actually leveraging all the cloud can actually do.  
Them: Right. So if I come over here, let's go to products. Courses. And over here. To LinkedIn campaign creators. Another thing I want to toy with, but I've been using Stanley. I don't know if you're familiar with that.  
Me: No.  
Them: For LinkedIn. It's kind of interesting. I've been toying with LinkedIn for a while, and I may abandon it because it's such a pain in the ass over there, but I keep playing with it, you know, to figure it out. My thought on this. When I look at all of these, like, I can tell from usage in people aren't really leveraging it.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Well, one, because. Are they even getting campaigns to run? You know, that's the big thing.  
Me: Right.  
Them: So that's where Creator Finder, I think, is going to be a big help. I've been going live in the group every day this week to get people going forward. It's actually working. We've got folks that have got deals coming together.  
Me: So nice.  
Them: In the group, so that's good. And then we're going to run it all next week as well. So we're going live in the. In the paid group once a week. But when I look in here, I think, The things are important. Like, I still love this piece of it. The AI Offer crafting. Like how I use this to create my as long as I've done an offer call. And I've got other data that I've gotten from them, other assets that they've used to sell their offer. I can take that stuff. Take this prompt. Go into Claude. And have it fire me up like a really solid. Offer worksheet, which is where all the content really is going to be pulled from for the most part. On a. On a campaign, for example, or in writing. So I've got. To offer worksheet that I've designed for, you know, people that are going into Meaningful man or those. Those prospective individuals. And so, you know. I don't know if we would do that. We? This might just stay in the. In here. I don't know. That this would be a tool that we would use to kind of do that. But I know how important offer worksheets are, period, to writing at all.  
Me: Right.  
Them: And especially in everything that I write, that I have him, that I have Claude do. And then being able to model, you know, Travis's offer worksheet for agency initiative, like that thing is like the most in depth thing I've ever seen. When I started doing deals, I was like, oh, my God, no wonder. My offer sucks because I'm not doing what he's doing right.  
Me: Right. Yeah.  
Them: So being able to pull all that data from the offer call from whatever they've given me as far as asset usage. And then being able to put them, take that content and then sort it. And categorize it within an offer worksheet. Is probably one of the most important pieces now. You know, my question is, would we want to bake that into this? I don't know.  
Me: Yeah. I mean. Yeah. It's kind of hard to say without. Without thinking all the way through, because I don't.  
Them: Yeah. I'm just throwing it out there.  
Me: But I. I could see just thinking of, like, similar tools that are out there. Like, you know, they've kind of got. The whatever you can put in your information about your brand or whatever. And it kind of stores that. In the database so that it can build off of that. And I think having that would probably be super useful if it wouldn't muddy everything up in there, which I think probably find a way to do.  
Them: Right. Right. Well. And that kind of goes back to what I did here with Thread Creator. They can do up to five pdfs, but. It needs to be same context. PDF's, right? Like all five of those. Like, I can't do deals over clients. Like the book. And then do you know? Referral partner transcript from a call that I did. And then an AMA about doing something completely different and then expect it to poop out stuff. That makes sense, right?  
Me: Yeah, that makes sense.  
Them: So you could do one PDF or you could do several PDFs, but they've all got to be the same kind of idea category. Context wise. So. And I'm just talking out loud here. We're just throwing stuff on the table. Because my thought was if I did, if I was going to create this myself, This is kind of like the deep context that you give it. Right. Because here's my thing. If they use it, they're probably not going to want to use it on their stuff, on their own stuff. But then they're going to want to use it per partner.  
Me: Right.  
Them: So I would want to be able to give them the option to say, okay, I'm writing today for my stuff. Let me give it some context. And then. Okay. Pull all that out and then upload. I'm writing for a partner today. But the core of it, like, you know, Travis's IP more or less is the foundation of any of it. Right. It's just that you're putting on different clothes today. Like, hey, this is for my stuff. Hey, this is for partner stuff.  
Me: Right. Exactly.  
Them: Does that make sense?  
Me: So holding, in which context do you want to work off of?  
Them: Right. And I think the voice DNA is the same way. Right? You pop it in there. Because, you know when I'm doing voice, when I'm doing Claude, I set up new projects for each partner.  
Me: Yep.  
Them: Right? So I ran this partner. This partner, but they all get the same. I've got, like, a whole document that I upload, a whole folder. That's based. They've all got the same fundamentals, which is Travis's IP stuff. But then I'm also uploading all of the additional transcripts of additional resources that they've given me or assets that I have, like emails, whatever. And then of course, the voice doc I create and I put I upload in here, too, so that whatever comes out comes out in their voice. Right.  
Me: That makes perfect sense.  
Them: So I'm thinking along the same lines with, you know, when it comes to this, Like that offer thing, you know? Could be something that's baked into it. Might not. But again, that's why I'm just kind of, like, putting all this in there.  
Me: Yeah, I was going to say, I feel like building that in would make it easier for people to use and actually make it something that they would. Would stick with.  
Them: Right. Continue to use it. That's right. The rudolph story. You know, like, is it important? Yes. But, gosh, you know, I just don't think people leverage it or would use it the way it needs to really be used, you know what I mean?  
Me: Right.  
Them: Offer foundation tool. If I'm looking at this as simply a writing tool, I don't think this falls in. To the usage.  
Me: Yeah. I feel like that could become part of something else.  
Them: Yep. Cap creator tool. If we're using it to write, like, T3 and T ones. Then certainly, yes, but I think Cap is something that should be baked into emails anyway.  
Me: Yep.  
Them: You know, especially if you're trying to do bullet stuff, things like that. Triangle of insight. Definitely t1 creator tool. Yeah. In the symptomatic subject line? Yes. So it's kind of in my thought was like, if I had to. Categorize everything and figure it out. Like I would have some kind of. Of God bless you. I would have some kind of. Like here. Where you know the topic, additional instruction. Like, I don't. I don't know about this so much, but, like, almost, instead of a call to action, this would be kind of like, okay, what am I writing today? Is it a T1? T2. Hel island. Right.  
Me: Yep.  
Them: Something where it makes it that. Like dumb. Easy. For them to go. Okay, I'm writing a t2 hell island. T2. Right. Or nurture and pick or whatever it is, right? And so we kind of have those. Frameworks that allow them to kind of, like, take that stuff and merge it into it.  
Me: Yep.  
Them: My Noah's Arc stuff that I did over here in. In this have all turned out, like, really good. And like the Noah's Ark guide. I have a bunch of stuff I can put in there. But what I was doing was when I was playing around with this, I took all of Travis's Noah's arcs. And then a guide that I had created. Using a guide creation prompt, and I created an entire guide. Which structures everything. And then I can use this as a means of which to. Educate claude. Right.  
Me: Yep.  
Them: And this guide prompt is like money in of itself. And it just takes, you know, something like a. Like a. If it was like a 20 page something or other, it just prop. It puts it into a guide. Which you've seen in the paid group and the free group. Let's come over here. Like these guides.  
Me: Oh, yeah.  
Them: Like here. This was all from that prompt where I took stuff that either I had done or Travis had done. Boom. Spits it out in these, like. Very neat, organized. Now, I still needed to go through a little bit and tweak a few things.  
Me: Brian? Sure.  
Them: But I mean, overall, like, people love these guides because they can. It's, it's practical. They can get through it quickly. It's not a three hour video. You know, and it just step by step, sit and does all that sort of stuff. So it's a really useful prompt when I'm kind of giving Claude these sequences and these things.  
Me: Right.  
Them: So that's how it pretty much created my guide. I gave it my voice DNA. Poops it out in my voice. And then I've got, like, you know, I just keep refining it to where it's, like, doing what I want it to do. And then this was a Noah's Arc email. The AI crisis and genuine influence. So I use this for one of my partners. And, you know, it got some attention. It worked.  
Me: Oh, very nice.  
Them: So.  
Me: Use this for a T1. It look like.  
Them: Yeah, it was a. Well, it was a T1 Noah's Arc like. So I started out with two emails, and they're just. You can call them pre t ones. But there was no call to action. It just says, over the next few days, I'll share what I'm seeing and what successful professionals are doing about it. More tomorrow. Now kind of fun. His list was not as they were a lot of freebie seekers and whatnot. So that's what happens when you name your books Go giver. You just go and get everything away. Nobody wants to pay for anything.  
Me: Gotcha. Yeah. That makes sense.  
Them: So. But, yeah, it worked really, really well when I was creating stuff so I could create a whole thing for the Noah's Ark, and I've got, you know, quite a bit of stuff. Don't look at my ugly. Desktop. This is all testing from. Yeah, I'm all testing a bunch of this image stuff now. Desktop 2. Is it over here, Tony prompts. Like, these are the ones that are kind of, like, more solid that I've used a bunch. I even took Travis's. I don't know if you remember or not. Back in the day, he did a. What's it called? He did a. Facebook ads, training on how he would do it. And so I turned that into a prompt and a tool, and it spits out really, really solid, like, symptomatic ads and whatnot. So, but I've got.  
Me: Remember that.  
Them: Yeah. Yeah, it's pretty cool. So, anyway, I've got a bunch of these prompts that I've kind of created. That I was wanting to Some of them I was wanting to turn into tools like the LinkedIn strategic content and the hashtag. Hashtags aren't really relevant over there now, so I don't really need that. But the strategic content thing was a thing, so I can share any of those if it's useful. And then I'm happy to use my Claude, you know, of course, API for the stuff. That we're playing with.  
Me: Oh, cool. Yeah.  
Them: Yeah, dude.  
Me: Great to me.  
Them: And then, yeah, everything we do on it, as far as I'm concerned, would be 50. 50 minus whatever. You know, Travis is getting something out of it, you know, so if he gets 10%, then it's, you know, 40. 40 or whatever.  
Me: Yep. Yeah.  
Them: Or however that works. Yeah, something like that.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: But, yeah, like, again, right now, it's like, what would make our lives easier, you know? And this is kind of what would do it.  
Me: Yeah, I think that'd be. That'd be a huge asset to have, if nothing else, just for. Just for our own use, like you said.  
Them: Yeah, I can go in a Claude and I, you know, and I do this stuff, and it's like, you know, I could see where. Like with Claude, with the. It's. You know, you've got this file drawer, but the drawer, the file just keeps getting bigger and taller and taller, you know, and it's kind of like. It'd be nice if I could, like, categorize things a little bit. Wiser, you know, like, okay, here's partners. And then have that be like a file where there's drawers in it. Or, you know, like where it's got files in the drawer.  
Me: Y.  
Them: Right. So I think about that, like, when we're thinking about this and setting stuff up, because, you know, I'm saving all the threads that people generate. You know, in thread Genius. I'm gonna do the same thing with that one where it's gonna be like, okay, here's, you know, like, right now, I've got, like, where I want to create a category for just. Like, deals where clients promos and then promos for referral partners. And, like, have those be, you know, cabinet drawers. And then with each one of them, then there's all the files. Like, I think about the same thing here, right? Like, here's my personal stuff for maybe such and such campaign. And then I can. And then I can have those in there, and then have campaigns within that drawer for myself and then have one for partners. And then each partner would have their own file drawer. Right. So that's kind of how I'm thinking about, like, if people were to use this, I'd want it to be super user friendly in that way.  
Me: Eah.  
Them: Right? So that. Because they'll be storing their, you know, that data in there.  
Me: Yeah, I'm with you because that. That seems like that's such a sticking point in a lot of Cloud and AI that, you know, so much good stuff, but you lose so much of it just because of the organization factor.  
Them: Cool. Yeah. Exactly. And. And I'm pretty organized when it comes to a lot of this stuff. Don't judge me by my current desktop. Right now. I've just been going on a testing rant.  
Me: IES desktop is clean these days.  
Them: I usually keep it pretty clean, but, like. Yeah, but with testing this, you know, all these images and downloading them, you know, I'm gonna stick them in a folder here soon. But, yeah, it's like, I'm pretty organized with that sort of stuff because I just want to be able to access it pretty. Quickly, you know, even my Google, my Google Docs. So the layman, I. You walk in there, you're like, oh, my God, this is terrifying. You know? But then I create master lists for everything where all these individual. Like, if I just pop in, master list, and I have all these master lists that come up for. Partners for prompts for, you know, whatever, and they're all linked on there. Right.  
Me: I got you.  
Them: So it's a madman's kind of, you know, organization model there for something like that, but. Makes sense. Cool.  
Me: Well, sweet. Yeah, that sounds great.  
Them: Awesome. Dude. Let me know. What? What? What you need or what? What would be best to. To get started? I think right now, like you said, the UI is, you know, probably the first and foremost place to start and just see what looks good and. And then I want to go with minimum Bible product, of course, as always.  
Me: Yep.  
Them: I've talked about some of the things that we'd love to bake into it. And. You know, being able to. Type in it, of course, and you know the sort of things and change whatever. But we can get to all of that as we want, and then, like I said, we can live through looms right now if it's easiest for you and stuff like that, so, But.  
Me: Sounds good to me. I was going to say, I know I've got the next week or so here, that I'll probably be hopping in there. And stirring stuff up. But, yeah, next week I'll be traveling a little bit, Kind of fly out to Baltimore, some agora stuff.  
Them: Okay? Okay? Zane. Yeah, perfect. Yeah, same for me. I've got next Thursday. Friday we're flying to Alabama for Gran. She's getting her master's degree, so she's graduating, so we're flying out there.  
Me: Oh, that's huge.  
Them: Yeah, yeah, we're super excited for. And then. And then I'm staying here for the rest of the month, and then we're going to be going up, like, for New Year's, we're going up to Flagstaff, which is a couple hours from here. For New Year's. That's really it. So, yeah, again, I'm not high pressure timeline or anything, but, you know.  
Me: Yeah, I figured you probably weren't under a time crunch or anything, but.  
Them: No. This is something I'd like to have, and it would make my life easier. And, you know, and then, of course, sooner it goes than. I mean, yeah, if it works out really well and it's something we're happy with. You know, we could roll it out and make some. Make a couple bucks with it, too, so.  
Me: Cool. Well, yeah, that sounds great. I. Yeah, I know. I definitely don't like dragging my feet too much on these sorts of things, so I'll probably be itching to jump in there in the next couple of days and see what I can. See what I can put together at least for, you know, for. For the. Front end and what that looks like, then we can go back and forth like you said of loom. Works great for me. So if you want to just shoot whatever over on your thoughts about it, then, then that works great.  
Them: Yep. Yep. Cool. Dude. Yep. Same. Yep. Okay? And then I'll be sure to. You may already have a bunch of this stuff that I've got in there for of Travis's ip, but I'm happy to put it in a Google Drive and, you know, pop it over to. So you have that. Just let me know when you need it.  
Me: Cool. Okay?  
Them: Okay?  
Me: That sounds great.  
Them: Cool, dude. All right, man. I appreciate you. I guess I'll see you here in about 20 minutes.  
Me: We'll see.  
Them: Awesome, brother. Appreciate you see? Bye.
