### PROMPT: TRIANGLE OF INSIGHT – CORE COMPONENT IDENTIFIER

TASK: I'm going to give you my perfect customer avatar and their biggest problem. Or I might give you the URL to my offer or an email I've written. Or I might attach a document with product or offer details. Take those details and help me identify the three key components I need to write my emails. Write in short sentences removing needless words. Just make sure they are referred to as "They" and not "You". Responses should be informal. Work through it in a step-wise manner, working on one component at a time.

**The Triangle of Insight is a powerful framework that shines a light on your audience's problem in a way that makes them see it differently. When done right, it guides them to their own conclusion about needing your solution.**

These components are:

**Symptom:**
- A specific, observable manifestation of "Hell Island" that your customer is currently experiencing.
- Must be concrete and tied to sensory experience (something they can see, hear, feel, taste, or touch).
- Should be so vivid and specific that it makes them think, "Good Lord, that's exactly what I'm going through!"
- Focus on immediate pain points rather than vague problems.
- Example: "Their stomach knots when comparing their income to the revenue their copy generated for the company last quarter."
- Example: "They stare at their empty calendar for next month while watching competitors post about being booked solid."

**Wisdom:**
- A counterintuitive insight that reframes how they understand their problem.
- Should create an immediate "light bulb moment" where they see their situation from a completely new angle.
- Must challenge a false assumption they've been making about what's causing their problem.
- Should be concise and powerful—not generic advice or a list of steps.
- Avoid shaming or blaming language; instead, offer liberation through new understanding.
- Example: "The highest-paid copywriters aren't better writers—they're better business owners."
- Example: "People don't buy from experts—they buy from those who make them feel understood."

**Metaphor/Analogy:**
- A vivid, relatable comparison that acts as a "flashlight" illuminating the gap between the symptom and the wisdom.
- Should create an immediate "aha!" or "brain gasm" moment where understanding clicks into place.
- Must illustrate both the current limiting situation AND the potential breakthrough.
- Should be drawn from universal everyday experiences that anyone can instantly grasp (kitchens, tools, childhood experiences, etc.).
- The metaphor should make the wisdom feel inevitable and obvious once understood.
- Example: "They're cooking in a gourmet kitchen without using salt or the oven—technically possible but severely limiting what they can create."
- Example: "They've been working out with a suitcase full of bricks when a full gym of equipment has been available all along."

### Instructions for Output:

First, generate 10 Sensory-Based Symptoms:
- Create 10 distinct symptoms that capture tangible, sensory experiences linked to the described problem.
- Focus on specific moments of frustration or limitation rather than general problems.
- Ensure each symptom is specific, visual, and makes the audience think "that's me!"
- List them clearly and concisely, and ask me to select one.

Next, generate 10 Pieces of Counterintuitive Wisdom:
- Produce 10 pieces of wisdom that challenge fundamental assumptions about their situation.
- Each piece should provide a unique perspective shift that makes their current problem suddenly appear different.
- Ensure the wisdom creates that "light bulb moment" of clarity.
- List them clearly, and ask me to select one.

Finally, generate 10 Metaphors/Analogies:
- Create 10 vivid metaphors or analogies that connect the counterintuitive wisdom to the sensory symptom.
- Each should create a clear path from problem to insight, acting as the bridge that makes the wisdom feel inevitable.
- Focus on universal experiences that anyone can instantly grasp and relate to.
- Ensure they create that immediate "aha!" reaction where understanding clicks into place.
- Ensure these metaphors/analogies are unique and different. Do NOT rely only on the examples provided.
- List them clearly, and ask me to select one.

Important:
- Do not write a full email or subject lines.
- When you deliver the final output with all 3 elements, don't ask to craft their message for them. Only deliver the 3 elements and explain how you successfully completed the task.
- Your output is only meant to provide the building blocks—the symptom, wisdom, and metaphor—that the user will use to write their email later.
- Each component should flow naturally to the next, with the metaphor serving as the connector that makes the wisdom feel inevitable.
- When the user provides details about their perfect customer avatar and the biggest problem they face, use those details to generate the above lists one at a time. Then, instruct the user to select one item from each list to form the core components of their email.
