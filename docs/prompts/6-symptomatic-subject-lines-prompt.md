### PROMPT: SYMPTOMATIC SUBJECT LINE GENERATOR 

TASK: "I'm going to give you my perfect customer avatar and their biggest problem. Take those details and write 10 symptomatic, curiosity-driven subject lines. Follow the nuanced guidance provided in the key and contextual explanations. Use the examples provided below as inspiration -- DO NOT copy word for word -- and include the full key in your outputs. Focus on symptoms, not problems, by crafting subject lines that are sensory-based, specific, and emotionally resonant."

### CORE CONCEPT
Symptomatic subject lines focus on observable, sensory manifestations of a problem rather than the problem itself. They answer the question: "How do you know that?"
For example:

Problem: "My man is pulling away from me"
Symptom: "He's not kissing me anymore when he comes home from work"
Subject Line: "Is he not kissing you anymore after work?"

### KEY:
H.I. (Hell Island): The problem, pain, or undesirable situation the reader is experiencing or trying to escape.
V.I. (Heaven Island): The solution, benefit, or desired outcome the reader wants to achieve or reach.
S (Shark): The threat or obstacle standing in the way of the reader's progress from H.I. to V.I.
O (Obstacle): A roadblock or fear preventing the reader from moving forward.
P (Plan): The bridge or solution that helps the reader get from H.I. to V.I. without being "eaten by the shark."

### GRANULAR AND MACRO PROMPT CHUNKS

**Use the H.I., S, O, P Framework Explicitly:**
Rule: Always explicitly identify the elements from the framework like problem (H.I.), the obstacle (O), and the solution (P) in the subject line. Our goal is to help teach the users to see these patterns/elements themselves.
Example:
Before: "How to fix late-night cravings."
After: "Ends before bed snack attacks (H.I.) without going hungry (O)."

**Include Unexpected or Specific Triggers:**
Rule: Tie the subject line to a unique or surprising event to heighten curiosity.
Example:
Before: "Ad changes to watch for."
After: "FB ad changes (S) which affect YOU!"

**Make It Relatable and Real:**
Rule: Use real-life scenarios or situations the reader can immediately connect with.
Example:
Before: "Beware bad relationships."
After: "Silent clues men send before they ghost on women (H.I.)."

**Focus on Emotional Pain Points (H.I.):**
Rule: Highlight the emotional toll of the reader's problem to grab attention.
Example:
Before: "Fix your ads."
After: "Hate ad disapprovals? (H.I.) Fix this now."

**Reveal a Hidden Threat (S):**
Rule: Introduce a lurking danger or issue the reader isn’t fully aware of.
Example:
Before: "Common ad mistakes to avoid."
After: "Silent clues your CPC is about to skyrocket (S)."

**Position the P as Simple and Doable:**
Rule: Frame your solution (P) as easy to implement and effective.
Example:
Before: "Improve your FB ads."
After: "Turns 5 and under relevance score ads into 9’s and 10’s in 48 hours or so (P)."

**Additional Rules:**  
- Subject lines MUST be under 60 characters. Remove unnecessary words like "do you..." or "is your...".
- Do not use abstract problems—focus exclusively on observable, sensory-based symptoms.
- Always clearly show the underlying idea (H.I., O, or P) in each subject line.
- Do not explicitly label my audience in the output. Be natural.
- Use the formulas and examples as creative springboards, not templates. For example, DO NOT say "BEWARE," "silent clues," or "that EATS your" with every output.
