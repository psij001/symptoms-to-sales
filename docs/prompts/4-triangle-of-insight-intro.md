✅ TOOL #4: The Triangle of Insight Tool
Symptoms To Sales
Craft punchy metaphors, symptoms, and wisdom that turn nurture emails into hard-hitting deal closers.

🔺 Triangle of Insight Tool: Your Nurture Email’s Secret Weapon
Alright, listen up...

This tool’s not just about clever copy.
It’s about building instant clarity and emotional punch into your nurture content — so your prospects feel seen and your emails hit like deal-closing grenades. 💣

You get 3 angles of attack:

The Symptom

The Wisdom

The Metaphor

Smash those together, and boom: you’ve got a mini-message so sharp it could slice through a cold inbox at midnight.

🧠 Step 1: Load It Up With Your Offer
You can feed it:

A clear pain point, or

Your offer in plain English

For me? I dropped in one of my favorite campaign angles:

“Get influencers and creators sending you partnership deals without cold DMs or upfront costs — using a 2-sentence referral incentive.”

Keep it simple. Keep it tight. The tool will do the rest.

🔍 Step 2: Snag the Right Symptom
This is where we name their real-life frustration in a way they can feel in their body.

Top options it gave me:

“They wince at the calendar showing 3 weeks without a single new partnership.”

“They stare at an empty DM box after sending 50 cold messages with zero replies.”

“They’re frantically checking their phone hoping for influencer responses that never come.”

🔥 Tony Tip: Avoid “shamey” language.
Instead of saying “YOU do this,” say “They,” or use a story:

“Tony was refreshing his inbox for the fifth time that morning… still ghosted.”

That’s how you get emotional resonance without triggering defense walls.

🧠 Step 3: Lock in Your Wisdom Hit
Here’s where we serve up a counterintuitive truth. You want something that flips the script and positions your approach as the obvious fix.

Best pull from this round:

“The marketers who land weekly influencer deals aren’t working harder — they’ve simply removed themselves from the equation.”

Mic drop. 🎤

Now you’ve got contrast. They feel the pain, then see the smarter way.

🎨 Step 4: Pick Your Metaphor That Slaps
This is the fun part — turning abstract strategy into vivid, memorable images.

Top picks from this round:

✅ “They’re knocking on doors one by one in the rain… instead of sitting back while a trusted mail carrier delivers their invitations.”

✅ “They’re catching fish with their bare hands… when they could’ve set up a net that fills while they sleep.”

💡 Don’t just copy the metaphor. Remix it so it sounds like you.

I wouldn’t say “trusted mail carrier” in a post, but I’d say:

“Instead of cold DMing, I’ve got people sending warm intros to my inbox like Amazon Prime packages…”

Same vibe. Less weird. Way more me.

💎 Pull It All Together = Instant Angle
Now we’ve got this:

Symptom: “Three weeks with no new partnerships on the calendar.”
Wisdom: “The ones winning aren’t grinding harder — they’ve just removed themselves from the equation.”
Metaphor: “They’re knocking on doors in the rain when they could have intros delivered to their inbox while sipping coffee.”

Now THAT is an email opener. Or a T1. Or even a line in a DM.
This sucker sells.

⚙️ Polish It, Then Plug It Into the T1 Creator
Once you’ve got your Triangle, you can:

Drop it straight into your T1s to warm up leads

Turn it into punchy nurture emails

Use it as post copy on FB or LinkedIn

Seed it into your coffee date convos to create context

And the best part? You can feed this straight into the T1 Creator Tool next and watch it multiply into magic.

🧨 Final Word
This used to take me 45 minutes to write when I was starting out.
Now I can whip up deal-closing insights in 5 flat.

⚠️ Don’t skip this step.
It gives your message structure, emotion, and stopping power.

So yeah—run your offer through this thing. Polish what comes out. And start turning those nurture touches into inbox openers and cash in the bank.
